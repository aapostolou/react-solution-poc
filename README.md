# What is this repo about:

What is shown here is a bare minimum presentation about a different way of working with redux in order to get some advantages like:

- no mapStateToProps boilerplate in every component
- no mapDispatchToProps boilerplate in every component
- no more switch cases in reducers
- simple actions and event actions running the flow of our app
- using redux selectors pattern for accessing state props

## What may be a first here in this repo:

- redux-observable middleware
- RxJS
- universal action creators (the main point of this repo)
- redux-actions node module in order to avoid lengthy switch cases
- basic redux selectors pattern

## Installation

```
npm install redux react-redux redux-observable redux-devtools-extension redux-actions rxjs lodash
```
